# DriveSecurity
Drive security system (use any drive as a key)

The "Drive" class contains 2 methods, "UseAsKey" and "CheckKeyValidity".

Using UseAsKey will result in the creation of a Code.txt file containing a long and slightly encoded code.

Using CheckKeyValidity will check if the drive contains a Code.txt file and if the Code.txt file contains a valid code.


The DriveWatcher class allows you to actively know what drives are in the computer.

Just create an instance of it and call the starting method.
