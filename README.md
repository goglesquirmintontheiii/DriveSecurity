# DriveSecurity
Drive security system (use any drive as a key)

The "Drive" class contains 2 methods, "UseAsKey" and "CheckKeyValidity".

Using UseAsKey will result in the creation of a Code.txt file containing a long and slightly encoded code.

Using CheckKeyValidity will check if the drive contains a Code.txt file and if the Code.txt file contains a valid code.


NOTE: Codes generated by this are not program-specific. Generated codes can be used by ANY program no matter what program generates it.
